# scRNAseq - NFATc2 

The project aims to identify differential expression pattern specific to a patient with NFATc2 mutation.

*Step 1* Integrate datasets of multiple treatment conditions and sequencing platforms

*Step 2* Compare patient data with healthy controls to identify patient-specific cell type and gene expression changes

*Step 3* Conduct scRNA-seq on a subset of differentially regulated genes in healthy family controls
